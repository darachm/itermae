Development
=========================

``itermae`` is still in alpha development by an active user of the script.
Contributions to the project are very welcome, and I would explicitly solicit:

* feedback on the interface design - how to make this easier to use?
* feedback on the documentation - how to make this more clear?
* advice on the internal algorithms - how to make flexible output/filtering
  specification faster than ``eval``'s?

The best way to get in contact is to
`submit an issue <https://gitlab.com/darachm/itermae/-/issues>`_.
Discussion, pull-requests, everything is welcome.

Current priorities:

* stabilizing the interface
* writing proper documentation (this!)
* writing more a maintainable test suite (extensive yet semi-automated generation)
* writing Docker -> Singularity containers
* experimenting with improving performance

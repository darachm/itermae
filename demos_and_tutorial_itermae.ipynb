    "\n",
    "This tool exposes you to a lot of complexity to maximize the flexibility of application.\n",
    "Thus, as in genetics, trail-and-error can map the code to phenotype map and help you get the function you want\n",

    "### Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "How to write an operation? Each operation has two parts. \n",
    "There's the part on the left that is what the operation is applied to, the part on the right that is the \n",
    "regular expression to apply, and between these is ` > ` (that is : a space, greater than sign, a space).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### inputs\n",
    "For your first operation, the input has to be `input` because that's the only available sequence, the input sequence of the sequence record. If you use mutiple operations, you can feed groups \"captured\" from previous operations as inputs to later operations (we talk about this later in this guide).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### regular expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there's the regular expression. These are complex, and `itermae` is designed to expose this complexity \n",
    "to the user directly so that you can do more with the tool! Here, I will try to explain a cookbook/copy-paste \n",
    "version that you can use if you're new to regexes and need to trial-and-error the result you want:\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern you define is matched against the read. So the pattern `.` will match one letter of anything, \n",
    "which is why I used it in the above examples (it always matches!). Putting an `ATCG` will only match when\n",
    "there's exactly a `ATCG` in the read, anywhere in the read, but exactly those four letters in that sequence.\n",
    "If you want to only one character of DNA, you can use `[ATCG]` to match any one of those four letters. \n",
    "*Always use uppercase for `itermae`!* If you want to include `N`, you can do that with `[ATCGN]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To match two letters, you could write `[ATCGN][ATCGN]`, or more easily `[ATCGN]{2,2}`. \n",
    "The `{}` braces help you specify how many to match. \n",
    "You can specify one number `{2,2}`, or a range `{2,5}`.\n",
    "So for a DNA barcode of length 18-22 bases, you may want to specify `[ATCGN]{18,22}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(` `)` parentheses are used to denote groups, like they're used in math. \n",
    "Capture groups use these `()` but also use `?P` and `<>` brackets to name the group. \n",
    "A named capture group uses notation like `(?P<barcode>[ATCGN]{18,22})`, where \n",
    "`(?P<` is the start, `barcode` is the name of the group, and the group is whatever \n",
    "matches to `[ATCGN]{18,22}`, until the `)`. It's complex syntax, but necessary to clearly\n",
    "denote what is the name of the group and what is the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match this barcode only when it is between defined sequences, for example priming sites, you can use a more\n",
    "complex pattern like `GGTCTCT(?P<barcode>[ATCGN]{18,22})CGTACGCT`. This matches a sequence where:\n",
    "- There is a `GGTCTCT`\n",
    "- then 18 to 22 bases of either A, T, C, G, or N\n",
    "- then `CGTACGCT`\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, it then saves that center 18 to 22 bases as a group named `barcode`.\n",
    "That means you can then only output that group, or you can put it into the output ID, or you can even match\n",
    "other operation patterns against _just that group_.\n",

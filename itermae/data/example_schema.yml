# Example config YAML file for itermae. Indentation is hierarchical structure, 
# ':'s denote if it is a dictionary key structure, 
# '-'s preface array/list elements.
# Comments are of course prefaced with an octothorpe.

# Input section (here first, but order doesn't matter)
input:
    from: STDIN # This is the default
    format: fastq # Default, can be FASTQ, fasta, txt, SAM (case don't matter),
                  # or something that you know BioPythonSeqIO handles
    gzipped: false # Default

# Defining the matches to run, the first and subsequent
matches:

    -   use: input # Default
        pattern: NGTCCACGAGGTCTCTNCGTACGCTG # Specify in IUPAC. Just use one N
                                            # for barcodes/variable length seqs
        marking: ABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBCDDDDDDDDD # Then specify what each group is
        marked_groups:  # Then use the same character from marking to denote
            A:          # additional info about the group, saveAs names, length
                name: sampleIndex # Name to save it as, optional
                repeat: 5            # How many times to repeat it, either this
            B:                       # Or there's min max specification below
                name: prefix
                allowed_errors: 2 # How many errors are tolerated in this match?

                allowed_substititions: 2

    -   use: barcode # Subsequent matches can use previous captured groups as
        pattern: N   # input, here just pulling the first five nucleotides
